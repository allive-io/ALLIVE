Welcome to the official source code repository for ALLIVE!

ALLIVE is an intelligent healthcare ecosystem based on blockchain technology. It is
comprised of three modules: Olife builds a self-perfecting profle of individual's health
data, Olivia acts as an artifcial intelligent general doctor, and Oleaf creates a
comprehensive healthcare service system. In ALLIVE, users have complete control over
their own health data, which can be analyzed by the AI doctor to create personalized,
full-process healthcare management. Meanwhile, the ALV token economy can also
incentivize all participants to contribute to the healthcare ecosystem in their own way,
thus truly achieving precise equilibrium of supply and demand of medical resources in
a decentralized, immutable, and intelligent healthcare ecosystem on the blockchain.

## Terms

### ALV

ALV is the primary token within ALLIVE. It is used for on-chain asset transfer, issuing digital asset,
facilitating data storage, and executing transaction. It can also be traded f or fat currency and other
cryptocurrencies.

### Derivative Token

Derivative Token is the digital asset designed and issued by the DAPPs in ALLIVE. It can be traded for
goods and services in the DAPP. Users obtain derivative tokens by trading with ALV, or by contributing
to ALLIVE and its DAPP’s to earn rewards.

### DAPP

Decentralized applications within ALLIVE, which will cover all aspects of healthcare services, including
but not limited to chronic disease management, medical technology, medical services, drug traceability,
insurance processing, payment and settlement, and medical fnancial services. They will leverage
ALLIVE’s blockchain network to create high-quality comprehensive healthcare experience.

### Olife

Olife is the decentralized, self-perfecting, and comprehensive profle of individual's health data in
ALLIVE. Users’ health data in each DAPP will be linked to the profle, which updates with each use.
Through such integration of data in a decentralized and encrypted fashion, ALLIVE breaks the data
silos while maintaining health data privacy and control, eﬀectively transforming the evidence-based
and centralized healthcare system into a personalized, precise, and omnipresent lifestyle. In addition,
the data upload process is completely private, decentralized, and encrypted. No one will be able to
access or make profts without data owner’s consent.

### Olivia

Olivia is a super AI doctor of over 3 years’ R&D. The AI medical inquiry system is made possible by
formulating a medical knowledge map with machine learning algorithms through the combination of
digital technology and medical databanks. Olivia produces more than simplifed and standardized
reports, but will be able to provide personalized healthcare plans by analyzing user health profle and
leveraging the vast data resources on ALLIVE.

### Oleaf

Oleaf is a turn-key solution for DAPPs to connect onto ALLIVE. It helps ALLIVE to integrate fullprocess healthcare services and complete a closed loop of healthy lifestyle that covers general health
management, doctor’s appointment, prescription flling, insurance processing, etc.

### PoS

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a mechanism designed for public chain consensus where the producer of the
next block is selected based one’s ownership stake of the network as a method of interest alignment.

### PoA

Proof of Authority is a mechanism for consensus frst introduced by the Ethereum community which
uses block validator’s authority within the network as a stake. It has improved on scalability but is still
susceptible to a potential threat of supernode collusion.

### VBFT

VBFT is a consensus algorithm that combines PoS, VRF (Verifable Random Function), and BFT. Based
on key factors of a network, VBFT can support scalability of consensus groups, guarantee the
randomness and fairness of the consensus population generation through VRF, and ensure that state
fnality can be reached quickly.

### PoNA

ALLIVE balanced blockchain issues of common concern and adopted PoNA consensus mechanism to
improve processing power, fault tolerance, ﬂexibility, and network security.

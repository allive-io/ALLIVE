Welcome to the official source code repository for ALLIVE!

ALLIVE is an intelligent healthcare ecosystem based on blockchain technology. It is
comprised of three modules: Olife builds a self-perfecting profle of individual's health
data, Olivia acts as an artifcial intelligent general doctor, and Oleaf creates a
comprehensive healthcare service system. In ALLIVE, users have complete control over
their own health data, which can be analyzed by the AI doctor to create personalized,
full-process healthcare management. Meanwhile, the ALV token economy can also
incentivize all participants to contribute to the healthcare ecosystem in their own way,
thus truly achieving precise equilibrium of supply and demand of medical resources in
a decentralized, immutable, and intelligent healthcare ecosystem on the blockchain.
